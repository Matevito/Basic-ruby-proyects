A Mastermind game using Ruby!
---
The object of Mastermind is to guess a secret code consisting of a series of 4 number digits(using only numbers from 1 to 6). Each guest results in feedback narrowing down the possibilities of the code. For more info about the history or more narrow concepts of the game, please take a visit in the page of wikipedia about the game.

What is this?
---
This proyect consist on a version of Mastermind using ruby and that runs directly from the command line. To run the game the file that needs to be open in the terminal is "main.rb". The objective of this proyect is to practice oop.

What have I learned?
---
OOP is hard but I have to admit that this proyect, even when has been harder than the tic-tac-toe one, is more organized regarding the methods of the diferent objects that needs the game. I have the feeling that I'm slowly understanding the advantages of using OOP and how to use it. Even then, I still think that the road to really understand and apreciate OOP is still very long so in these days will be checking a book about the logic behind thinking about oop.

Things to do!
---
1.Implement in the Cpu class methods that contain the logic of algorithims able to solve Mastermind games consistently.

2.Clean the logic of the game in the main.rb file.
